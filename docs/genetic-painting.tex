\section{Introduction}
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system, has been widely studied over the past decades. A specific branch of generative art uses computer algorithms to show(most visually) regularity of mathematical patterns and show variability from pseudo-random numbers, it's known as algorithmic art. A typical example of algorithmic art is fractal art as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fracal}.

Intelligent optmization algorithms are espeically designed to deal with NP-hard, non-convex, non-smooth optmization problems, the complexity of the problems and the bionics nature of intelligent
